PLUMP (Planning & Logistics for Unified Management of Projects) is a full-stack project management platform built to help teams coordinate tasks, track progress, and collaborate efficiently. Developed as a semester-long software engineering project, it provides a unified environment where users can organize workflows, visualize data, and manage project logistics seamlessly.

### Course Context
This project was created for the **S25_CO-561-A_Software Engineering ** taught by **Joaquin Aguado** at Constructor University.  
The course emphasized real-world engineering practices including modular backend design, teamwork, documentation, testing, and full-stack collaboration.

### My Role
I contributed as a backend developer, primarily focusing on API design, database modeling, and authentication. My responsibilities included:
- Designing and partially implementing the API architecture using NestJS and TypeORM, with smooth integration of SQLite as the database.
- Setting up Swagger API documentation to improve API accessibility, testing, and developer workflow (this part is not included in the public GitHub repository as it belongs to a different submission and is still being finalized locally).
- Implementing comment functionality with optional file attachments by extending the Prisma schema with new Comment and Attachment models.
- Developing backend endpoints to create and fetch task-related comments, ensuring secure and structured data handling.
- Setting up the PLUMP project module using the NestJS CLI and building its controller and service to process HTTP requests.
- Collaborating with two backend teammates to implement JWT-based session authentication, and updating the Prisma schema to support secure password storage.
- Contributing to the project presentation materials by preparing slides and assisting in writing the script for the live demo.
